<p>netnet.studio is still in <em>beta</em> but it&#39;s already being used by students at various universities. Here&#39;s what some of the Media Art and Design students at the University of Chicago have (anonymously) said about their experience using it in the classroom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;[netnet] was one of the coolest parts of the class. I really appreciated the interactivity of the software, as it allowed me to learn by doing as well as listening.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The interactive tutorials were fun and more engaging! Even though I have experience with HTML and CSS from other classes, I still felt that it was a good foundation for rally understanding how HTML works and found the tutorials valuable.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Coding on netnet really highlights the creative aspect of coding and obscures the more boring technical parts like git and version control etc. I think it&#39;s great for beginners and super user-friendly.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;netnet was great because I could see all of my changes take place immediately [this] allowed me to experiment more.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>netnet.studio is a <a href="http://netizen.org" target="_blank">netizen.org</a> project being designed and developed by <a href="http://nickbriz.com/" target="_blank">Nick Briz</a> and <a href="https://www.sarahrooney.net/" target="_blank">Sarah Rooney</a> with help from a handful of <a href="https://github.com/netizenorg/netnet.studio/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">other contributors</a>. The current &lt;BETA-3.0&gt; version of netnet was made possible thanks to financial support from the <a href="http://clinicopensourcearts.com/" target="_blank">Clinic for Open Source Arts</a>, the <a href="https://www.saic.edu/academics/departments/contemporary-practices" target="_blank">Contemporary Practices Department at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago</a> and <a href="https://cms.uchicago.edu/undergraduate/major-minor/minor-media-arts-and-design" target="_blank">Media Arts and Design at the University of Chicago</a>.</p>
